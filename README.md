Hybrid Clicker + Casual Prototype (Unity + Ready Player Me SDK)

**Status:** In active development (prototype stage)

Avatar_Clicker is a prototype of a hybrid mobile game that combines classic clicker mechanics with light casual gameplay elements.  
The central idea is that the player interacts with their own 3D avatar — automatically generated through **Ready Player Me** — which becomes an active part of all gameplay loops.

## 🎮 Core Features

### 🧍 Ready Player Me Integration  
Seamless integration of the **Ready Player Me SDK** allows players to create a 3D avatar using a selfie or the RPM editor.  
The generated model is automatically imported into the Unity scene and serves as the main interactive object.

### 💸 Hybrid Clicker Loop  
Players earn in-game currency by clicking on their avatar.  
The core clicker mechanic is enhanced with casual elements to make the gameplay smoother and more dynamic.

### ⚡ Casual Mini-Game with Temporary Boosts  
Includes the first mini-game that grants a short-term income boost.  
The design follows a short gameplay cycle:  
**clicker → mini-game → boost → return to main loop.**

### 🖥️ UI & Visual Prototype  
A basic interface is implemented: currency counter, buttons, and multipliers.  
The main scene features a **neon night city** backdrop, serving as a stylish visual environment for the avatar.
